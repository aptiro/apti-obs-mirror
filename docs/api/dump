High-level Romanian authorities support the private sector in promoting anti-piracy messages, but their efforts have not translated into concrete steps to bring copyright criminals to justice, and enforcement actions in the past year have dropped. As a result, piracy remains widespread in Romania for all forms of copyright works, especially in the online space, where international pirates seek safe haven from better-enforced terrain elsewhere in Europe. Making matters worse, in 2013 the Court of Appeal held that the making available right in Romania is subject to mandatory collective administration, contradicting Romania’s obligations under the WIPO Treaties to provide an exclusive making available right and the means to enforce it. We encourage the Romanian Government to address this troubling development, adapt the country’s laws to the modern environment, encourage a national policy of cooperation against online infringement, ensure police officials are competent and well-equipped to conduct raids and investigations efficiently, and give targeted prosecutors and courts the authority and training to bring piracy cases to speedy conclusion, with deterrent sentences and penalties.

The DMCA was the first major digital copyright law passed in the United States, creating strict procedural rules for how and when a copyright holder can claim that uploaded content infringes on their copyright. US-based tech companies that receive these infringement notices must comply with these rules to receive their safe harbor—the protection they have from being liable for hosting unlawful user content.</p><p>The DMCA has become a global tool for censorship, precisely because it was designed to facilitate the removal of online media. The law carries provisions on intermediary liability, among many other strict copyright enforcement rules, which induce websites, Internet service providers, and other such ""intermediaries"" to remove content that is alleged to be a copyright infringement.</p></div></div></div>",1,"2014-12-03 20:40:07",Global,ipr,"law, copyright, online-speech, takedown-notice, online-media, internet-service-providers, digital-millennium-copyright-act, intermediaries, isp, internet, copyright-infringement, censorship",government

Paul Rosenzweig <a href=""http://www.lawfareblog.com/2014/12/congress-tries-to-stop-the-iana-transition-but-does-it/"">wrote on the Lawfare blog</a> that this does not totally prevent the transition from happening, because “the act of <em>not signing</em> a contract (which is what NTIA proposes to do) costs nothing.</p><p>But this relatively optimistic view overlooks the fact that completing the transition requires a bit more than just not renewing ICANN’s contract. It also requires NTIA to amend its Cooperative Agreement with Verisign.

And, if NTIA is to ensure that the transition meets its own criteria – such as not allowing intergovernmental control, having widespread support, upholding the ‘multistakeholder model’ and maintaining the openness, stability and security of the Internet, NTIA needs to review and approve the plan submitted to it by the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group.</p>",1,"2014-12-12 08:00:08",Global,ig,"ntia, internet-governance, iana-transition, us-congress, iana-stewardship-transition-coordination-group",government

But this is far from enough. The safe harbor isn't compulsory and it doesn't apply to leaks of information that are of vital public interest, but that don't expose illegality—such as the TPP text itself.<p>Another important area of dissent from the U.S. negotiators' hard line appears in the <a href=""http://keionline.org/sites/default/files/Section-H-1-11-of-Enforcement-TPP-IPChapter-11May2015.pdf"">Enforcement section of the IP chapter</a>, in which every single country is now lined up against the U.S. in favor of a remedy for victims of wrongful copyright abuse.

The AGCM processed 134 dossiers: 57% in ordinary procedures and 43% in urgent procedure (requiring a decision within 12 working days). 42% of the requests concerned audiovisual products; 23% photographs;14% audio products; and 12% editorial works. Very few requests concerned literary works, software and videogames. About 55% of the dossiers ended with the spontaneous removal of the contested content, while 35% of the procedures regarding strong violation of the regulation ended with the DNS block. The actions against piracy carried out by Italian authorities and in particular by the Guardia di Finanza allowed to block the activities of 15 illegal platforms in the sector of music industry. On April 29, 19 online kiosks have been closed by the Guardia di Finanza, in the framework of the operation “Black Press Review”.&nbsp; According to the AGCOM these data show the efficacy of the IPR regulation.

This Crime Anticipation System (CAS) has already been experimented in, among others, Amsterdam and The Hague. In the pilot phase of the system, cities were divided into subjects of 125 by 125 meters. Of these subjects, crime data were collected for two years. Based on this data, the chance of a new incident can be calculated. These include crimes involving a pattern such as bicycle theft, burglaries, baggage wrecks and car crashes.</p><p>On the basis of that data, for example a weekly hausse on bicycle showcases on Friday afternoon, the police's schedule can be adjusted. The data may also give rise to burglary prevention in certain neighborhoods. The test took place in Amsterdam, The Hague and cities in East and North Netherlands and Noord-Holland. The system records the addresses of [those who frequently commit crimes] and suspects in a radius of 500 to 1000 meters. The distance to the nearest resident suspect in cases such as burglary and street robbery is also recorded. Corporations wishing to join the system can register with the National Police. It strives to connect all [police forces] to the system by the end of next year. The Netherlands is then the first country in the world with such a policing system. Agents receive an update of risk areas every week.
