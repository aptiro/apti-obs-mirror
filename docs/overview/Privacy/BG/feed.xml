      <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bulgarian Parliament has approved a package of amendments to the Electronic Governance Act (EGA) with the aim to facilitate and enhance the process of adopting e-Government in its fullest. Some of the most notable legislative texts include the requirement for all software, designated for government purposes to be open source and developed in a public repository (Article 58a of the EGA) and the establishment of an Electronic Government State Agency (EGSA), which will be responsible for the correct implementation of e-Government concepts (e-ID, Network and data security, Certification services, etc.) and projects. The EGSA will be assisted by a new Unified System Operator State Enterprise, which will constitute an informational contact centre for citizens and business entities. The Unified System Operator will also function as an action centre in response to incidents, related to breaches of data security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional information is also available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novinite.com/articles/174957/Bulgarian+Parliament+Votes+to+Set+up+E-Government+State+Agency&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Bulgarian Parliament adopted the Electronic Identification Act (EIA) in May 2016. The legislation will come into force on the 20th November (a 6-month vacatio legis period) and will enable citizens to unambiguously identify themselves in the virtual space and thus benefit from digital government services or perform secure financial transactions online. In a long-term perspective the EIA will also open doors for the introduction of e-voting on a national level. Natural persons, aged 14 or higher, will receive an electronic identification number from the Ministry of Interior or an authorized e-ID administrator. Last but not least, the EIA introduces a Digital Register for Empowerment, which will give citizens the opportunity to authorize other persons to represent them before state officials or providers of public services.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Council of Ministers in Bulgaria approved the draft Bill on Electronic Identification</title>

      <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On 23rd September, the Council of Ministers in Bulgaria approved the draft Bill on Electronic Identification and proposed that the National Assembly passes it. The draft bill provides for a regulation of electronic identification of natural persons. The Bill delineates the powers, functions, obligations and responsibilities of all participants involved in the issuing and management of electronic identity of natural persons. The draft Bill, if enacted into law, would aim to achieve a better degree of effectiveness of electronic governance oriented towards consumers and businesses alike. It is also expected that the future law could address one of the governmentâ€™s key priorities to introduce electronic governance as a primary platform for state modernization which is also a key factor and an important condition for implementation of sectoral reforms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
