ICANN and European registrars have &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/22218-amsterdam-refuses-to-publish-whois-records-as-gdpr-row-escalates&quot;&gt;clashed over this long-standing contractual requirement&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/document.cfm?doc_id=48839&quot;&gt;does not comply&lt;/a&gt; with European data protection law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was one of the highest profile topics at ICANN&#039;s 60th meeting in Abu Dhabi which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/contractual-compliance-statement-2017-11-02-en&quot;&gt;EFF attended last year&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;with registries and registrars laying the blame on ICANN, either for their liability under the GDPR if they complied with their WHOIS obligations, or for their contractual liability to ICANN if they didn&#039;t.

The referendum vote took place on September 25, 2016, after a coalition of civil society organizations and political groups had collected the required number of signatures to force a referendum vote on the law.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

As previously reported in the EDRi-gram, Privacy International won the first-ever case against GCHQ in the Tribunal, which ruled that the agency acted unlawfully in accessing millions of private communications collected by the US National Security Agency (NSA), up until December 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this victory, now anyone in the world can try to ask if their records, as collected by the NSA, were part of those communications unlawfully shared with GCHQ.

For example, AT&amp;amp;T will serve up ads to restaurants near a concert you may be buying tickets for, or an ad for a new dishwasher from Best Buy if you’re researching one being sold by Sears.&lt;p&gt;And it includes spam. “For example, if you search for a car online, you may receive an email notifying you of a local dealership’s sale,” AT&amp;amp;T says.

But what does society lose when a private corporation rules public information?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine months after the European ruling, it is clear that Google’s implementation has been fast, idiosyncratic, and allowed the company to shape interpretation to its own ends, as well as to gain an advantage on competitors and regulators forced into reactive mode. It avoided a broader and much deeper reflection on digital public space, information sedimentation, and the exploration of collaborative solutions between public and private actors – such as a joint request service across different search engines, with processes for getting confidential advice from publishers and public officials.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

The recent tweaks mean two new privacy protections for those that U.S. law considers foreigners (in this case, people who are &lt;i&gt;outside&lt;/i&gt; of the United States borders who are neither U.S. citizens nor legal U.S. residents). The new protections are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the U.S. government collects information about a foreigner, it will consider the &amp;nbsp;privacy ramifications before disseminating that information, such as to other governments;&lt;a title=&quot;The exact language from IC on the Record is: &amp;quot;All agency policies implementing PPD-28 now explicitly require that information about a person may not be disseminated solely because he or she is a non-U.S. person and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has issued a revised directive to all Intelligence Community elements to reflect this requirement. Intelligence Community personnel are now specifically required to consider the privacy interests of non-U.S. persons when drafting and disseminating intelligence reports.&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml#footnote1_onnb91f&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the U.S. government collects information on innocent foreigners not connected to any crime or investigation and the information has no national security value, it will dispose of that information after five years.&lt;a title=&quot;IC on the Record explains: &amp;quot;We have imposed new limitations on the retention of personal information about non-U.S. persons. Before PPD-28, Intelligence Community elements had disparate restrictions on how long information about non-U.S. persons could be retained. PPD-28 changes these retention practices in significant ways to afford strengthen privacy protections. Now Intelligence Community elements must delete non-U.S. person information collected through SIGINT five years after collection unless the information has been determined to be relevant to, among other things, an authorized foreign intelligence requirement, or if the Director of National Intelligence determines, after considering the views of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence Civil Liberties Protection Officer and agency privacy and civil liberties officials, that continued retention is in the interest of national security.&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml#footnote2_02qj4je&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s right, the world&#039;s personal information will only be retained for five short years.
