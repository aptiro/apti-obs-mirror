What is relevant is whether the invention does not result from the state of the art in an obvious manner. With this remark, the Supreme Court dismissed Leo Pharmaceutical&#039;s cassation appeal and endorsed the decision of the Appeal Court in which EP679154 is deemed to lack inventive step.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
