        Obama announces new privacy rules for non-US citizens

        <div><div><div><p>President Obama <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/one-year-later-obama-failing-promise-rein-nsa">recently announced</a> slight changes to NSA data collection practices. The recent tweaks mean two new privacy protections for those that U.S. law considers foreigners (in this case, people who are <i>outside</i> of the United States borders who are neither U.S. citizens nor legal U.S. residents). The new protections are:</p><ol><li>If the U.S. government collects information about a foreigner, it will consider the &nbsp;privacy ramifications before disseminating that information, such as to other governments;<a title="The exact language from IC on the Record is: &quot;All agency policies implementing PPD-28 now explicitly require that information about a person may not be disseminated solely because he or she is a non-U.S. person and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has issued a revised directive to all Intelligence Community elements to reflect this requirement. Intelligence Community personnel are now specifically required to consider the privacy interests of non-U.S. persons when drafting and disseminating intelligence reports.&quot;" href="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml#footnote1_onnb91f">1</a> and</li><li>If the U.S. government collects information on innocent foreigners not connected to any crime or investigation and the information has no national security value, it will dispose of that information after five years.<a title="IC on the Record explains: &quot;We have imposed new limitations on the retention of personal information about non-U.S. persons. Before PPD-28, Intelligence Community elements had disparate restrictions on how long information about non-U.S. persons could be retained. PPD-28 changes these retention practices in significant ways to afford strengthen privacy protections. Now Intelligence Community elements must delete non-U.S. person information collected through SIGINT five years after collection unless the information has been determined to be relevant to, among other things, an authorized foreign intelligence requirement, or if the Director of National Intelligence determines, after considering the views of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence Civil Liberties Protection Officer and agency privacy and civil liberties officials, that continued retention is in the interest of national security.&quot;" href="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml#footnote2_02qj4je">2</a></li></ol><p>That’s right, the world's personal information will only be retained for five short years. And that's if the U.S. government decides you're <i>not</i> under suspicion.</p><p>David Medine, the chairman of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, has <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/03/obamas-surveillance-reform-extends-unmatched-privacy-to-foreigners/">said</a> that "There’s no country on the planet that has gone this far to improve the treatment of non-citizens in government surveillance."</p></div></div></div>

        <p>On February 11th, the European Parliament has adopted a resolution in which it commits to work toward finalising, by the end of 2015, a directive on EU Passenger Name Records (PNR). This proposal aims at the systematic data collection, retention and analysis by national authorities of passengers taking flights entering or leaving the EU. This data, originally collected by airline companies, contains <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/28/european-commission-blanket-collection-passenger-data">plethora of personal data</a>, from passengers’ personal and contact details, itinerary, payment methods, to sometimes even food preferences.</p>

        <article><section><p>U.S. Senator Al Franken is probing into the privacy policies of LG and Samsung Electronics for the voice recognition technologies they use in their Smart TVs. The move follows reports that Samsung Smart TVs collect data from voice communications and even share them with a third party.</p><p>In letters Wednesday to Samsung’s North America CEO Gregory Lee and LG’s U.S. President William Cho, the Democrat from Minnesota asked whether it was necessary for the companies to collect personal communications in order to operate the voice recognition feature.</p><p>“If such communications are unnecessarily captured along with voice commands, <a href="http://www.franken.senate.gov/files/documents/150211PrivacySamsungLetter.pdf">is it possible to extract that data before transmission</a> to a third party?” Franken wrote.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></section></article>
