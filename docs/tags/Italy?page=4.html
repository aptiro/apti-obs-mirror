        Sharing Economy Act - the first Italian legislative proposal on the subject
    </div>
    <div class="panel-date">
        Wed 2 Mar 2016, 23:07
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>On March 2, a group of deputies belonging to the Innovation Joint Committee presented a legislative proposal about the Sharing economy. Sharing economy is growing up in Italy: there are 186 collaborative platforms, generating around 13 billions of revenue (in the sectors of peer-to-peer finance; accommodation sharing; staffing online; car sharing; sharing of video and music). The proposed legislation contains norms concerning issues such as the protection of privacy of the users data or the taxation to be applied on sharing economy exchange (10%). This proposal was the object of an open consultation on the web until May 16, 2016. Following that, a series of auditions at the Chamber of Deputies will take place, before its discussion and approval by the Chamber. At the same time sharing economy was the object of seminars and meetings involving relevant stakeholders such as the National Antitrust Authority; AGCOM, the Ministry of Finance, enterprises and public administration, lawyers. Among the most relevant one can quote the seminar organized by the European University of Rome, or the workshop on the role of communities in the sharing economy held in May 2016, in the framework of the Forum of the Public Administration.</p>

        The new Code of the Public (Digital) Administration
    </div>
    <div class="panel-date">
        Mon 15 Feb 2016, 23:03
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>The Italian Council of State published its consensus about the New Code of Public Digital Administration - CAD. After this, the Code will be discussed and then approved by the Parliament. Meanwhile, an important debate is currently ongoing on the measures and interventions needed to change the Italian public administration into a digital one and on the interventions needed to develop the digital capacities of users.</p><p>The new CAD is focused on the issue of digital citizenship and in this framework. It introduces several changes in the existing rules in order to align the old Code to the new purposes and the European law (for instance for what concerns the validity and efficacy of electronic documents as forensic evidence). In this regard it provides for changes or new norms related to electronic documents and their storage and electronic signature and emphasizes the importance of the digital identity (SPID) and of the digital domicile.</p><p>It also introduces the role of Chief Digital Officer and of Digital Ombudsman in each public administration body and establishes a Permanent Conference for technological innovation; the norms of the new CAD have to be applied not only by public bodies but also in legal trials.</p><p>Part of the criticism to the New Code concerns the elimination of important norms related to the obligation for enterprises and other organizations to set up digital disaster recovery and business continuity plan; or the elimination of most of the norms and provisions for implementing and deploying smart cities and communities, or the removal of the obligation for the Public Administration to use free software. Other critics expressed their concern about the excessive anonymisation of data for privacy protection affecting the open data approach and lamented the low level of participation and involvement of stakeholders in the formulation of the new CAD.</p>

        Towards the end of the monopoly of SIAE?
    </div>
    <div class="panel-date">

        <p>Between May and June 2016 two important Italian singers – Fedez and Gigi D’Alessio - expressed their will to abandon the SIAE – Società Italiana Autori ed Editori (Italian Society of Authors and Publishers) and to protect their IPR rights by Soundreef. One of the main reasons for their choice is the lack of transparency in the mechanisms of attribution to each author of his/her rights, while in the field of audio and video, the new technologies could allow each author to monitor the use and the reproduction of their own music, songs and products.</p><p>The debate following the publication of the decision of these two singers stressed the need to reduce the monopoly of brokerage that SIAE holds in the field of IPR and to strengthen free market and competition. In the debate the need for Italy to adopt the EU Directive 2014/26/UE on the collective management of IPR was also stressed. In this regard, one expert, Prof. Scorza, proposed to have a public body able to guarantee the protection of IPR rights and to establish an online registry of IPR, with information for each author of the brokering agency chosen, the contract signed, etc. For the Italian Antitrust Authority, the adoption of the Directive might represent an occasion to open the IPR Italian market of brokering agencies, and to allow the freedom of choice for the authors.</p><p>More information is available <a href="http://www.agendadigitale.eu/smart-cities-communities/che-cosa-insegna-gigi-d-alessio-sul-futuro-del-copyright-per-l-agenda-paese_2276.htm">here</a>.</p>
