Exceptions are possible in case 1) of a subpoena or other compulsory request from a law-enforcement agency or a court. &nbsp;2) of prevention of emergency situations and extraordinary network overload.</p><p>A supervision and control functions are carried out by the <a href="http://www.ctu.cz">Czech Telecommunication Office</a></p></td><td>At the EU level, the government of the Czech Republic will promote net neutrality in such a way as to ensure the competitiveness of the European ICT industry and prevent any development that could put the European ICT industry at a disadvantage vis-à-vis other regions of the world.</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>The French Digital Bill. The <a href="http://www.gouvernement.fr/en/the-digital-bill">Digital Bill</a> establishes the principle of Net neutrality. Operators may not discriminate in providing access to the network on the basis of services. The French authority for regulation of the electronic communications and postal sectors (ARCEP) will be responsible for ensuring that this principle is observed. In concrete terms, they may not propose slower Internet to certain customers, and a faster connection to others.</td><td><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>The president of the <strong>ARCEP </strong>(<strong>Authority regulating electronic and postal communication</strong>) <a href="http://videos.assemblee-nationale.fr/video.6184.droit-et-libertes-a-l-age-du-numerique--m-jean-ludovic-silicani-pdt-de-l-arcep-4-decembre-2014">was heard</a> by the Review Commission on “rights and freedoms of the digital age” of the National Assembly on the issue of net neutrality.</p></td><td><p><a href="http://www.laquadrature.net/fr/neutralite-du-net-la-france-fait-le-jeu-des-operateurs-telecoms">Despite the European Parliament’s vote</a> on net neutrality, the French government seems to back the interest of telecom operators on NN.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>Yes</td><td><p>In addition to § 41a TKG, a new law, “Gesetz zur Auswahl und zum Anschluss von Telekommunikationsendgeräten“ (Act on the selection and connection of telecommunication terminals), entered into force on 1 August 2016.</p><p>The goal of the act is to liberalise the market for terminals as mentioned in directive 2008/63/EC (in particular router). An open and competitive market can strengthen net neutrality: As telecommunication providers could use software on their own routers to block certain services, a free market will limit the effect of such software on net neutrality.</p></td><td><p>The Federal government is allowed to enforce – with the agreement of the Parliament - net neutrality by issuing legal decrees against companies that operate telecommunication networks.</p>The Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) may provide a technical directive on the minimum requirements for the quality of service.</td><td>ISPs shall be forced to offer a free and fast internet for everybody; however, additional “data highways” can be set up for special services. (Position in the European Council)</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td><p>There is not an Italian Law on NN. But a draft bill on NN is waiting to be discussed &nbsp;by the Parliament since 2011. Elements of NN are contained in the Italian Code of Electronic Communication. The Italian Law establishes the rights for citizens to know if the operators enact some forms of restrictions in providing the service. Auditions at the Parliament on net neutrality of the Data protection adviser, of AGCOM Adviser and of the Competition Authority are taking place.</p><p>The Committee on Transport of the Chamber of Deputies started the deliberative process on a proposal of Law on net-neutrality, presented by Stefano Quintarelli (Democratic Pary) and signed by MPs of various political forces, titled “Disposizioni in materia di fornitura di servizi della rete internet per la tutela della concorrenza e della libertà di accesso degli utenti” on July 8, 2014. The work of the Commission on the proposal started on May 6, 2015; further sessions took place on June 23 2015; on September 15, 2015, on November 4 and November 24, 2015. The Law is composed by four articles. The proposal establishes the principle of net neutrality and introduces measures for a separation between the services for accessing the Internet and other services provided by the same operators. Another proposal is under discussion both at the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, concerning an amendment to the Italian Constitution introducing the article 34bis on the universal right to internet access. See the track of the proposal, <a href="http://www.camera.it/leg17/126?tab=4&amp;leg=17&amp;idDocumento=2520&amp;sede=&amp;tipo=  http://www.art34bis.it/la-nostra-proposta/camera-dei-deputati/">here</a>.</p></td><td>None</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p>During the months of November 2014 the Italian Presidency tried to find an agreement with the other members of the Council on the telecoms package and NN.

Taking into account the positions of the various members of the Council, Italy in its Declaration to the Council stressed the need to continue to work on roaming and NN in order to find an agreement. The Government reaffirmed the fact that NN represents a first reference value. It also reaffirmed that a&nbsp; free, open and not discriminatory web requires an adequate regulation and the need to the involvement of public bodies in the agreement among telecoms on this aspects. In this context, the Italian Government reaffirmed the centrality of the right of users to an adequate access to the web. An adequate access to the Internet has to be considered as a fundamental right and as an essential common.
