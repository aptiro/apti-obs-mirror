                    <p>In the past years, there have been an increase in European cases when intellectual property rights have been used as a tool to ask ISPs to block or filter websites – either through court actions or by voluntary measures. See also the caselaw of the European Court of Justice -&nbsp; SABAM vs Netlog (<a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&amp;num=C-360/10">C-360/10</a>) and UPC Telekabel case (<a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=149924&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=478162">C-314/12</a>).</p><p>The table below aims to highlight a snapshot of what is happening in several European countries – whether websites are being blocked or filtered by ISPs either as part of the IPRs infringement legal cases or by being included in national blacklists or other voluntary measures.</p>

The bill submitted by the Czech Ministry of Finance (CMF) newly regulates gambling and its taxation. § 82 allows CMF servants to ban internet games that do not meet criteria or do not have a license in the Czech Republic. Based on the ban the ISPs will be obliged to block particular gambling websites at their own expenses. The subject of controversy is focused on the fact that the banning order does not require a court warrant. Such a practice may facilitate massive internet censorship in the future. Many IT companies (including CZ.NIC – Czech domain registry) and members of civil society protested against the bill and filled a complaint at the Constitutional court.</p><p>The Constitutional Court ruled that the law is not in conflict with the constitutional order of the Czech Republic.</p></td><td>Online gambling websites with no licence issued by the <a href="http://www.mfcr.cz/cs/soukromy-sektor/hazardni-hry">Ministry of Finance</a> of the Czech Republic.</td><td>-</td><td><p>Not clear.</p>Few court decisions enforced withdrawal/deletion of data at the hosting services located in the Czech republic.</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>Yes</td><td><p>The piratebay.se</p>and 18 URL of the site (en .net, .org, etc.)</td><td><p><a href="http://www.lesnumeriques.com/the-pirate-bay-bloque-en-france-n37419.html">Paris Court of First Instance decision</a> based on requeirements of article L. 336-2 of the Code de la propriété intellectuelle (CPI)</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td>Court decision orders to Orange, Bouygues Telecom, Free, SFR to take all necessary measures in order to impede access to the website from French territory</td><td>Yes, as long as the list of blocked websites is not in conformity with CPI</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>No</td><td>Not applicable</td><td>Not applicable</td><td>Not applicable</td><td>Not applicable</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>Yes</td><td>For info on IPR blocking, see the AGCOM 2014 <a href="http://www.agcom.it/relazioni-annuali">annual report</a>.

At the date of January 23<sup>rd</sup> 2015, AGCOM has received 166 requests of intervention for breach against IPR on line. 30 procedures ended with orders of disabling the access, by blocking the DNS.</p>AGCOM, taking into consideration the principles of graduation, proportionality and adequacy established in the regulation, blocks IP only in particular cases – for example if the server is located outside Italy. Furthermore, on January 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp; 2015, the Match-off Operation against the web sites transmitting in streaming live and on demand film in contrast with the existing TV rights imposed the <a href="http://www.agcom.it/tutela-del-diritto-d-autore">shut-down of 124 pirate</a> web sites by the Nucleo Speciale Radiodiffusione Editoria of Italian Police.</td></tr><tr><td>Malta</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>No</td><td><p>Child pornography</p><p>websites.</p><p><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/best-popcorn-time-sites-blocked-dutch-effort-tighten-grip-video-torrent-streaming-1826224">Six Popcorn Time-affiliated sites </a>were shuttered by the Dutch anti-piracy organization BREIN in the Netherlands, including three Netherlands-based Popcorn Time sites -- popcorntime.nl, popcorn-time.eu and popcorntimefiles.nl. BREIN said that “Popcorn Time is an illegal service particularly popular in the Netherlands and gets a lot of media attention,” BREIN said in a roughly translated statement: “This free service competes with paid legal offers including Netflix.”</p></td><td>The Netherlands has criminalized acts of the possession, distribution and production of child pornography (Article 240b of the Dutch Criminal Code). Since 1 January 2010 ‘providing access to child pornography’ has also been prohibited in the Netherlands.</td><td>In collaboration with the ISPs, the government has established an ‘internet child pornography filtering platform’ . Furthermore, the Child Pornography Reporting Office keeps a blacklist of child pornography websites. In the future, the ISPs participating in the platform will use the list to block access to the websites. But the effort to complete such a list has been dropped recently and blocking is not likely to happen.</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Romania</td><td>Yes</td><td>Online gambling, child pornography, selling illegal psychoactive products</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>For the case of online gambling, the National Gambling Office makes a black list with unauthorised online gambling sites and force ISPs to comply with the blocking order (Decision no. 17 from 26.06.2015).</td><td><p>Yes, the law allows blocking of websites, if the users are properly informed.</p><p>However despite the electronic communications law, the National Gambling Office issued Decision no. 17 from 26.06.2015 forcing ISPs to block unauthorised online gambling sites and redirect visitors to a page hosted by the Special Telecommunication Service (STS).</p></td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>Yes</td><td><p>Content downloads or streaming (newpct.com, spanishtracker.com)</p><p>Rojadirecta / links to sporting events broadcasts</p></td><td><p>FAP v NewPCT, Juzgado de Instrucción Número 10 de Zaragoza</p><p>Juzgado número 2 de lo Mercantil de La Coruña</p></td><td>ISPs and DNS providers</td><td>Unclear, the site aggregates links to contents offered by others.</td></tr><tr><td>Switzerland</td><td>Not for purposes of IPR enforcement.</td><td><p>Currently, sites with visual depictions of sexual abuse of children (which are hosted outside of Switzerland) are blocked voluntarily by major Swiss ISPs on the basis of a confidential blocklist maintained by police.
