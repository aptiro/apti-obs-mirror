No single methodology on how to perform diligent search is in use at the moment.</p><p>No orphan work from the Czech entitled institutions has been added to the OHIM database so far.

Given the increase in life expectancy, these related rights for performers now expire during these artists’ lifetimes and at a time when they are generally no longer professionally active. The directive increases their term from 50 to 70 years. It has also sought to improve the economic system for producers, so that they can thus have the necessary resources to support new talent.</p><p>Secondly, the bill transposes Directive 2012/28/EU of 25 October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works. It enables libraries accessible to the public to digitize works belonging to their collections and regarded as orphan – i.e. whose copyright- and related rights-holders it has been impossible to find, despite careful searches – and make them available to their users. These works are thus made accessible to the maximum number of people, thanks to digital support and in a non-profit framework. This faculty is also open to museums, archive services, the guardian institutions of cinema and sound heritage, educational establishments and public broadcasting bodies. The works concerned take the form of books, reviews, newspapers, magazines and other written publications, as well as cinema and broadcast works.</p><p>Finally, the bill transposes Directive 2014/60/EU on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a member state. This revised instrument seeks to guarantee the return to a member state of any cultural object regarded as “a national treasure possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value” that was unlawfully removed from its territory after 1 January 1993.</p></td><td>Not implemented yet.</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>Yes</td><td>Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und weiterer Änderungen des Urheberrechtsgesetzes vom 1.

A data bank of the researches on orphan works has been established at the MIBAC. The results of the research activities have to be communicated as well to MIBAC.
